Dependency Injection in Rust

The goal of this crate is to provide a simple dependency injection framework
that is easy to use. Performance is not an initial concern, but might be later
on as the crate matures.

#### Name

The name coi comes from an inversion of the initialism IoC (Inversion of
Control).
